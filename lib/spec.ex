     for a standard US keyboard layout. The Unicode Private Use Area code points,
     0xE000-0xF8FF, are used to represent pressable, non-text keys (see Key record).

     The server must process the key sequence as follows:
      - Each key that appears on the keyboard without requiring modifiers are sent as a keydown followed by a key up.
      - If the server does not support native events and must simulate key strokes with JavaScript, it must generate keydown, keypress, and keyup events, in that order. The keypress event should only be fired when the corresponding key is for a printable character.
      - If a key requires a modifier key (e.g. "!" on a standard US keyboard), the sequence is: modifier down, key down, key up, modifier up, where key is the ideal unmodified key value (using the previous example, a "1").
      - Modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and Command/Meta) are assumed to be "sticky"; each modifier should be held down (e.g. only a keydown event) until either the modifier is encountered again in the sequence, or the NULL('null') (U+E000) key is encountered.
